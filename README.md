**UK Food Hygiene Ratings Analysis: Project Summary**

### Project Overview
For the "Eat Safe, Love" magazine, this project analyzed food hygiene ratings across various UK establishments to guide future articles and reviews. Using MongoDB, the data was effectively managed and explored to deliver valuable insights into the food industry standards.




- **Database Updates**
  - A new entry for "Penang Flavours," an emerging restaurant in Greenwich, was added to the database to include in the analysis despite it not having a formal hygiene rating yet.
  - Business type IDs were updated to maintain consistency across the dataset.
  - Establishments in the Dover area were removed from the database to align with the magazine's focus areas.
  - Data types for geographic coordinates and rating values were standardized to enhance data accuracy and usability.

- **Exploratory Analysis**
  - Detailed queries were executed to determine hygiene and general safety standards across establishments:
    - Identified establishments with a hygiene score of 20.
    - Analyzed establishments in London with a rating value of 4 or higher.
    - Pinpointed the top 5 establishments with the best ratings near "Penang Flavours."
    - Aggregated data by local authority areas to find regions with the best hygiene scores.

### Insights and Impact
The analysis provided a clear view of the hygiene standards across the UK, highlighting both top-performing and underperforming establishments. The magazine can now use these insights to target articles that promote high standards and caution against lower-rated locations. This project not only supports editorial direction but also promotes public health awareness through informed journalism.
